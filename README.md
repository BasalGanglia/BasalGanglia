### Brief Intro

I've been working on physiological computing since 2006 and I'm an expert in building real-time adaptive systems based on psychophysiological signals such as EDA, EMG, EEG, ECG, EOG, fNIRS, PPG, as well as magneto-and accelerometers, eye-trackers, depth-cameras, microphones, and light sensors to create
emotionally adaptive games, adaptive virtual commercials, dance performances, and even emotionally adaptive VR movies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on synthetic data / MLops.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure and MLops (never-ending study)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on MLops, time-series analysis, causal modeling.
